Create a Minecraft mod which adds a magical staff that could levitate mobs.

The staff has a depletable magicka source, which can be replenished by putting the staff into hot cauldron with water and mixing it with glowstone dust.
Staff has several variations, which tune specific parameters and staff icon itself.

Parameters:

Staff Area of Effect (single mob / multiple mobs in a radius)
Staff Range (max distance to be able to cast the levitate on mob)
Magicka amount
Levitation strength (bigger mobs need more powerful staffs, weak staffs can't levitate big mobs)
Also add particle effects for

The cast effect itself
The levitating mob idle particle effect
Staff replenishing mana in the cauldron (when glowstone mixing was successful)
Add visual indication:

When a cursor is hovered on the mob and the cast could be made (successful magicka / range checks), or not
Levitating mob limbs should rotate around in circular motion while it is levitating
Succesfull staff cast animation (first and third person) for the player
Unsuccesful staff cast attempt animation (first and third person) for the player
Also levitating mobs should lose own's movement control while levitating

Come up with some finishing / polishing touches yourself as you feel right
