# Levitation Staff Mod

A magical Minecraft Forge mod that adds powerful levitation staffs to the game, allowing players to levitate mobs with varying degrees of power and range.

## Features

### ðŸª„ Five Staff Tiers
- **Novice Staff**: Basic levitation with 8-block range (100 magicka)
- **Apprentice Staff**: Improved range of 12 blocks (200 magicka)

- **Master Staff**: Ultimate power with 25-block range and strongest levitation (500 magicka)

### âš¡ Magicka System
- Each staff has a depletable magicka pool

  - **Green**: Ready to cast
  - **Red**: Out of range or insufficient magicka
  - **Yellow**: Target too heavy for current staff

### âœ¨ Particle Effects
- **Casting**: Spiraling magical particles around targets
- **Idle**: Gentle sparkles around levitating mobs
- **Replenishing**: Golden particles rising from cauldron

### ðŸŽ® Animations

2. Fill the cauldron with water
